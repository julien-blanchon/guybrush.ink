- Stanford Computational Imaging Lab - Overview 06/2020 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VscA-ZvL1VA Video about the history of computation imaging. Very interesting "looking around corner" introduction, ie retroreflective reconstruction. Meaning to reconstruct the shape of an object occluted by analysing the indirect light beam. Also cover "Deep Optics" starting from 14:00
